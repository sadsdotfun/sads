🚀 SADS Prediction Terminal

Quantum Pattern Replication™ Interface
Route: /terminal

🌌 Page Positioning

This is not a scan page.
This is the cockpit where power users live.

Focus:

Real-time insights

Multi-address monitoring

Quant predictions & anomaly alerts

Historical context

Institutional UX

Professional tone. Zero crypto-casino vibes.

Think: Bloomberg + Palantir + Solana.

🔷 Core UX Philosophy

👉 Everything must answer these 3 questions instantly:

1️⃣ Is this asset safe right now?
2️⃣ When could a major risk event happen?
3️⃣ What patterns are indicating the future?

The UI is designed around those 3 answers.

🧩 Terminal Feature Script

The layout is column-based and crisp, with modular panels.

| Sidebar — Watchlist & Filters
| Main Stage — Predictions & Risk Feed
| Side Panels — Insights & Timeline

1️⃣ Left Sidebar — Asset Watchlist

Section title:

Watchlist

Default card content:

Token logo / label / last scan time

Mini risk badge:

Low / Moderate / Elevated / High / Critical

Actions:

Hover shows icons: [Pin] [Details] [Remove]

Drag-to-reorder

Spaces (like Discord channels):

“Personal”, “DeFi”, “New Launches”, “Red Flags”

Search bar:

Search any Solana address…

Button:

2️⃣ Main Stage — Prediction Overview

Top header:

Current Status
Live risk analytics updated every 10 seconds.

Then two stacked sections:

🔮 A) Real-Time Forecast Card (Wide)

Display module:

Overall Risk Forecast: High
(Badge color updates dynamically)

Under it:

Metric	Value	Helper Note
Quantum Similarity Score	0.81	Behavior matches prior rugs and liquidity exits
Temporal Fragility Index	0.73	Imminent instability expected within 24–48h
Liquidity Stability	23%	Insufficient liquidity depth
Holder Symmetry	Whale-dominant	Top 10 wallets control 87%

Refresh timestamp (muted):

Data updated: 6 seconds ago

⚠️ B) Risk Event Feed (Live Ticker)

Ticker that auto-scrolls newest events:

Sample items:

🔴 High: Unusual increase in dev wallet outbound transactions (⏱ 18–30h forecast)

🟡 Moderate: Rapid LP reduction detected (−12% in 10 mins)

🔵 Info: Large new holder added — source low-reputation wallet

Expandable row for each event:

Summary
What triggered it
Historical context
Probability vs time horizon
Suggested action

Call-to-action for flagged cases:

3️⃣ Right Side Panels — Time & Behavior Analysis

Two vertical modules:

⏱ A) Projected Risk Over Time (Graph)

Title:

Risk Projection Curve

Small onboarding note:

Scroll or click markers to explore future states.

Graph plotted in 4 forecasts:

Now (baseline)

6h

24h

48h

72h

Markers glow when tapped:

Tooltip example:

Predicted peak: 0.91 risk
Highly unstable behavior window projected
Primary drivers:
• Dev wallet surge
• Concentrated liquidity inflow
• Token distribution distortion

Also:

Confidence: 94%

Tiny toggle under the graph:

[ ] Continuous Monitoring (auto-rescan)

🧬 B) Similar Behavior Clusters

Title:

Historical Pattern Matches

Subtitle:

This asset’s behavior mirrors these past incidents.

Clean table:

Match	Category	Outcome	Time To Failure
92%	Meme token	Rug pull	26h
84%	NFT project	Abandoned	72h
78%	DeFi pool	Exploit	19h

4️⃣ Tertiary Tools (Tabs At Bottom)

Tabs:

🟣 Root Cause Analysis

⚙️ Developer Behavior

📈 Liquidity Structure

🛰️ Network Relationships

Each tab reveals a specialist view:

📤 Root Cause Analysis

What signal is actually causing prediction to spike?

Card layout:

Top trigger: “Dev wallet outbound transactions"

Contribution: 41%

Severity: High

Secondary factors:

Suspicious funding inflows

Unburnt mint authority

Missing token Metadata commitments

Button:

Show chain of events →

Timeline animation reveals step-by-step precursor events.

👨‍💻 Developer Behavior

Focuses on:

Known team wallets

Token admin actions

Authority transfers

Signals:

“Mint authority still active”

“Recently edited metadata”

“Owner wallet linked to prior incidents” (if applicable)

💧 Liquidity Structure

Clean, factual:

Pool	Depth	Primary LP	Lock Status
Raydium	42k	81% dev-owned	Unlocked
Orca	9k	Thin depth	Unknown

HP Bar: Liquidity Safety Index

Muted note:

Healthy liquidity doesn’t hide. It’s distributed.

🧩 Network Relationships

Graph node visualization (optional MVP → table)

Purpose:

Who’s connected to who?

Shared wallet ancestry?

Past linked behaviors?

Insight text:

This address is 2 degrees separated from a known rug cluster.

Tag:

7️⃣ Professional Disclaimer (Footer)

Predictions are generated from historical on-chain behavior and statistical modeling.
They suggest probabilities, not certainties. Always verify information and conduct independent research.

🌟 What Makes This Terminal Unique?
Traditional scanners	SADS Prediction Terminal
