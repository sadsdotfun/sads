SADS Predictive Console — Official Page Script
(Route: /app)

Quantum Pattern Replication UI

🛰 Page Purpose

The Predictive Console is where users enter a wallet or token address and initiate a live, animated quantum forecast showing:

Risk Event Windows — predicted future exploit times

Quantum Similarity Score — match to historical malicious behavior

Temporal Fragility Index (TFI) — likelihood of collapse

Anomaly Clusters — behaviors that break chain symmetry

Liquidity Manipulation Probability

This page transforms complex on-chain data into a breathing, orbital visualization.

🎨 Visual Layout

👇 Visual structure (z-index):

Layer 0: 3D animated purple nebula background
Layer 1: Central Orb Simulation Canvas (WebGL)
Layer 2: Side Data Panels + Output Chips
Layer 3: Input Command Bar + Action Buttons
Layer 4: Navigation (existing footer nav)

🧩 Core Interactive Components
1️⃣ Command Bar

Position: top-center overlay
Sleek, purple neon underglow

[ Enter wallet or token address here... ]   [ Run Prediction Scan ]


When typing:

Purple signal lines pulse outwards toward the orb

When scanning:

Button flips to “Analyzing Quantum Signatures…”

Orb splits into fragments → re-merging into future projections

2️⃣ The Orb

The star of the page — fully interactive 3D sphere of prediction

Behavior:

Idle: slow rotation + glowing pulse

Scan start: breaks into swirling particle swarm

Scan complete: two states appear side-by-side

Chain Reality (Present)

Predicted Quantum Future

Interaction:

Hover → internal neuron-like structures light up

Drag → rotate future projection timeline

Scroll → time dilation (see risk at different future windows)

You can scrub the future.

3️⃣ Orbital Data Chips

Orbiting UI elements that react to prediction output:

Chip Name	Value Example
Temporal Fragility Index	82% — High Collapse Likelihood
Quantum Similarity Score	77% match with past rug clusters
Liquidity Safety Score	12% (Critical)
Holder Symmetry	Imbalanced — Whale Dominance

Chips glow brighter when value worsens.

4️⃣ Timeline Ring

Circular scrub interface around the orb:

Segments:

6h

24h

48h

72h

7d

Each provides:

Risk spike indicators (purple peaks)

“Event windows” (click → expansion panel)

🔬 Event Window Panel (Slide Up on Click)

Example:

HIGH PROBABILITY EVENT DETECTED
21 hours from now

Bot funding activity increases

Dev wallet movement detected

Liquidity pool imbalance forming

Actions:

[ Add to Watchlist ]

[ Send Alert Notification ]

[ View Similar Historical Events ] → opens side panel

🧠 Sidebar Panel — Quantum Similarity Explorer

Slide-in from right
Searches cluster of similar past behaviors
→ visual chain of references with outcomes:

Behavior Match	Past Outcome
92% similarity	Rug within 36h
75% similarity	Pump & dump
48% similarity	Liquidity migration only

User learns:

“This has happened before — and here’s how it played out.”

🔄 Live Updating Mode

If user enables toggle:

Continuous Scanning Mode

The orb pulses every 30s:

Risk updates in real-time

Timeline shifts as predictions adjust

Event windows appear/disappear

Rogue surge:

Screen flashes purple static for 0.2 seconds (danger alert)

🗂 Technology Behind It
Backend Prediction (Mock API initially)

Endpoint:

POST /api/predict
{
  "address": "string"
}


Returns:

{
  "TFI": 0.82,
  "QSS": 0.77,
  "riskWindows": [
    { "timeHours": 21, "confidence": 0.94 }
  ],
  "anomalyCount": 5,
  "liquiditySafety": 0.12,
  "similarPastCases": [
    { "confidence": 0.92, "outcome": "rug" }
  ]
}

Frontend Visual Engine

Three.js + GLSL shaders

Particle physics orbit simulation

Timeline ring (SVG + GSAP animation)

State interpolation for future scrubbing

Performance consideration:

Lower-density orb on mobile

Disabled timeline ring scrub under 800px width

🛡 Alerts System (Phase 2)

Uses wallet auth + cloud notifications

Users can:

Follow tokens

Receive push alerts when new anomalous behavior expires prediction horizon

Subscription-based monetization.

✨ Microinteractions (Finishing Touches)
Action	Effect
Press Enter	Orb bursts → fractures → reform as prediction
Hover chip	Radiant shockwave through orb
High risk spike	Purple lightning arcs across background
Scroll in orbit	Futuristic time stretching sound
Idle 10s	Camera slowly drifts outward → more stars

This console must feel alive.
