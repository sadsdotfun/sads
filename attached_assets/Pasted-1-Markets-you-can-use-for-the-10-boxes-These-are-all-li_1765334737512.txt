Remember: on-chain, each YES share always pays 1.00 USDC if the outcome happens, 0 if not – that’s your “payout” structure. Your UI just converts the current YES price into implied odds + max payout.

2. Data config for the frontend

You can drop this into a markets.ts or similar and feed it into your React / Next app:

In production you’d overwrite yesPrice/noPrice with live data from your SADS backend or a Polymarket API mirror, but this gives you legit real-world numbers to demo with.

3. Layout script for the Prediction Console page

Think of the app page as:

Dark, minimal, same vibe as your SADS graphics.

Left-aligned header, right-aligned wallet button.

2–3 column grid of those 10 boxes.

Top bar

Logo: SADS glyph + “SADS Prediction Console” text.

Status pill: “Mainnet • Live odds”.

Wallet button: “Connect Wallet” (Phantom / Solflare etc).

Filters row

Category pills: All, Economy, Politics, Crypto, Gaming, Culture, Meme.

Sort dropdown: Most Active, Ending Soon, Highest Implied Edge.

Market card (each of the 10 boxes)

For each item in markets:

Top-left: small category chip (e.g. Politics).

Main title: market title.

Subline: favoriteOutcome, eg:

“Market favorite: 3 cuts (75 bps total)”

Big number row:

Left: Implied: 97% in soft purple.

Right: Yes: 0.97 • No: 0.03 (small, muted).

Footer:

“Payout: 1.00 USDC per winning share.”

Button: “Trade” ➜ opens the detailed trading page / modal.

Cards should feel like tiles in Polymarket but more SADS-branded: rounded corners, slight glow, hover that raises the card + brightens the probability.

4. Script for the Trading Page (when a box is clicked)

Route: /markets/[id] or open as a modal.

Layout

Two-column layout on desktop:

Left: Market context + chart

Right: Trade ticket

Left column

Breadcrumb + title

Breadcrumb: Prediction Console / Politics / Republican Presidential Nominee 2028

Title: Republican Presidential Nominee 2028

Subtitle: Current favorite: J.D. Vance · 55% implied

Odds chart

Card with:

Tabs: 24h, 7d, 30d, All

Line chart of implied YES probability over time.

Small caption: “Data sourced from on-chain orderflow, updated in real time.”

Right column – Trade ticket

Card titled “Place Trade”:

Toggle pills at top: YES / NO.

Display current best price:

Best YES: 0.73 USDC

Best NO: 0.27 USDC (pulled from your snapshot / feed).

Amount input

Label: Stake (USDC)

Input with quick buttons: +25, +50, +100, Max.

Calculated section (auto-updating):

Estimated shares: amount / price

Max payout: shares * 1.00

Implied edge: (1 - price) * 100% if they’re buying Yes.

Wallet state

If not connected:

Button: Connect wallet to trade.

If connected:

Button: Submit trade (primary, full-width).

Underneath: “Gas & fees shown before confirm.”

Risk footer

Small text:

Prediction markets are high risk. Do not trade more than you can afford to lose.

Same page layout works for any card in the grid – only the title, favorite outcome, prices and chart data change.
