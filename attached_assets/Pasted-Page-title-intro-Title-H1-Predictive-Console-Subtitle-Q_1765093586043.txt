Metric 1 label

Quantum Similarity Score

Metric 1 description (tooltip or helper text)

Measures how closely this address matches historical clusters of malicious or unstable behavior on Solana. Higher values indicate stronger similarity to past rugs, exploits, or collapses.

Metric 2 label

Temporal Fragility Index (TFI)

Metric 2 description

Estimates how fragile this address is over the next few days based on changes in balances, funding sources, and past outcomes of similar patterns.

Risk breakdown cards
Card 1 — Temporal Fragility

Title

Temporal Fragility Index

Status label (above the number)

Stability status

Possible statuses

Stable

Mildly Unstable

Unstable

Highly Unstable

Body example

This address shows movement and funding behavior consistent with assets that became unstable within the next 24–48 hours.

Bullets (short, factual):

Rapid shifts in key balances

Inflows from low-reputation sources

Activity out of line with age and size of the address

Footer note (small)

Higher fragility suggests a greater chance of sudden liquidity or price shocks.

Card 2 — Quantum Similarity

Title

Quantum Similarity Score

Status label

Pattern match

Example line

Matches 73 past high-risk incidents with 82% similarity.

Body text

We compare this address against a curated set of historical rugs, exploits, and failures. A higher score means this behavior has been seen before — and often ended badly.

Card 3 — Liquidity & Holders

Title

Liquidity & Holder Structure

Metric labels

Liquidity stability

Holder symmetry

Example copy

Liquidity stability: 21%
Holder symmetry: Whale-dominant

Body text

Most supply and liquidity are controlled by a small number of wallets. This structure has historically correlated with higher rug and manipulation risk.

Footer note

Healthier assets tend to have deeper liquidity and a more distributed holder base.

Risk over time section

Section heading

Projected risk over time

Chart subtitle

Forecasted risk levels based on current behavior and historical outcomes of similar patterns.

Tooltip text when hovering a point

Time window: 18–30 hours
Predicted risk: 0.91
Key drivers: dev wallet movement, LP imbalance, concentrated inflows.
